<msg type="warning" file="Xst" num="737" delta="old" >Found <arg fmt="%d" index="1">1</arg>-bit latch for signal &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="2">ibusy</arg>&gt;. Latches may be generated from incomplete case or if statements. We do not recommend the use of latches in FPGA/CPLD designs, as they may lead to timing problems.
